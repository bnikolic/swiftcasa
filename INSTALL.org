#+TITLE: Installation/Setup of  SWIFTCASA 
#+AUTHOR: Bojan Nikolic

* Notes

- CASACORE calls the =/bin/sh= command (through /system/ library call)
  in
  [[file:~/oss/casacore/casa/OS/Directory.cc::String%20command("cp%20-r%20'");]])
  when the /split/ task is invoked. This forces a consistency of glibc
  between CASA, the system install in /bin and the SWIFT-T build.

  Note that system(3) does not look through the path for which shell
  to execute, it is always =/bin/sh=

- CASA has dependencies on libuuid and libSM which are not bundled
  with the distribution
