#+TITLE: Installation/Setup of  SWIFTCASA 
#+AUTHOR: Bojan Nikolic

* Setup of CASA

- Install the =psutil= package via pip:

  #+BEGIN_SRC 
  /data/p/casa-release-4.7.2-el7/bin/pip install psutil
  #+END_SRC

  (=psutil= is used to end the CASA viewer processes which are spawned
  when plotting images)

* Known shortcomings with SWIFT/T

1. When using python there appears to be a bug in the optimisations
   with -O2 with current =noop2= function implementation. Recommend
   only use -O1. /I can't currently reproduce this -- recheck/

* Notes

- CASACORE calls the =/bin/sh= command (through /system/ library call)
  in
  [[file:~/oss/casacore/casa/OS/Directory.cc::String%20command("cp%20-r%20'");]])
  when the /split/ task is invoked. This forces a consistency of glibc
  between CASA, the system install in /bin and the SWIFT-T build.

  Note that system(3) does not look through the path for which shell
  to execute, it is always =/bin/sh=

- CASA has dependencies on libuuid and libSM which are not bundled
  with the distribution
